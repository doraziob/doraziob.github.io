### "GDP Growth Forecasting: Principal Components and the Student's t VAR Model"

With the advent of big data techniques, there has been a surge in popularity for forecasting
models which extract common factors from datasets containing many interrelated series.
Researchers who confront the ever-present curse of dimensionality often rely on
dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), to extract
the most important features from series. This paper expands upon the literature related to
principal components and GDP growth forecasting through the inclusion of the Student’s t
Vector Autoregressive model (VAR). Ultimately, it is found that the forecasts generated
using principal components from the Student’s t VAR model outperform forecasts generated
from Normal principal components in terms of prediction errors.

### "Macroeconomic Forecasting using Principal Components: Statistical Adequacy vs.Goodness-of-Fit/Prediction”

Principal component analysis (PCA) is one the most extensively researched and discussed
methods for reducing the dimensionality of large datasets. Over the last few decades, the
number of papers exploring PCA has blossomed into a variety of directions. The aim of this
paper is to revisit the use of principal component analysis in the context of macroeconomic
forecasting and to establish a baseline framework for not only achieving superior forecasts in
terms of accuracy, but also in terms of capturing the probabilistic assumptions inherent in
each macroeconomic data series. The framework is then applied to a dataset consisting of
commonly utilized macroeconomic indicators, and it is found that the statistically adequate
models perform better, in terms of mean-squared forecasting error, than the benchmark
autoregressive models.
